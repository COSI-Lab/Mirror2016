          According to archived COSI webpages, Mirror has existed as early as October 2002.
          The current server is the third iteration that has run the mirror service. A longer
          article on the history of Mirror can currently be found on #[a(href="https://cosi-lab.github.io/meeting-minutes/news/2016/08/08/Weekly-Newsletter.html") Meeting Minutes] and
          will eventually be put on the upcoming COSI History website.
